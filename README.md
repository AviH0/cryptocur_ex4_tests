# CrytpoCurrencies 2021 Ex4 tests

## Usage

- Clone the repository somewhere.  
- install dependencies:  
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
- make sure you have a Ganache instance running, and if needed udpate the port number at the top of `deploy.py`
- copy your RPS.sol file to the directory.
- run with `python -m pytest .`

### The tests are quite basic, feel free to add some more and share with everyone via pull request.
